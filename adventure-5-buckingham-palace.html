                </h2>
                <p>Today was an EXTRA special day! After our adventures at the red buses, Big Ben, the Tower of London, and Leicester Square, we were ready for something truly ROYAL! And what's more royal than Buckingham Palace - where the KING lives?!</p>
                
                <p>"Lexi! Lexi! Wake up! It's Buckingham Palace day!" I woofed excitedly, my tail wagging so fast I knocked over my water bowl!</p>
                
                <p>Lexi stretched all three of her legs, adjusted her green backpack, and meowed with a big smile, "Flo, this is going to be AMAZING! We're going to see where the King lives! Can you believe it?"</p>

                <p>I was SO excited I could barely stand still while Lexi packed her special green backpack with our adventure essentials: our trusty map, some royal-worthy treats, her favorite notebook, and my lucky red bandana (which made me look extra dashing, if I do say so myself!).</p>

                <h2 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-top: var(--spacing-lg); margin-bottom: var(--spacing-sm);">

                </h2>
                <p>We hopped on our favorite red double-decker bus - I'm quite the London bus expert now! As we rode through the streets of London, I pressed my nose against the window, watching for that first glimpse of the palace.</p>
                
                <p>"Flo, look!" Lexi called out, pointing with her paw. "There it is!"</p>
                
                <p>And there it was! Buckingham Palace, in all its glory! It looked like something from a fairy tale - so grand, so beautiful, so... ROYAL!</p>

                </h2>
                <p>When we got off the bus and walked toward the palace, my jaw dropped to the ground! Buckingham Palace was ENORMOUS! The building was so big and beautiful with its cream-colored stone walls, fancy windows, and the most famous balcony in all of England!</p>
                
                <p>"LEXI! LOOK AT IT!" I barked, doing excited spins. "It's HUGE! How many rooms do you think it has?"</p>
                
                <p>Lexi hopped up on a low wall to get a better view, her green backpack bouncing. "Actually, Flo, it has 775 rooms! Can you imagine? That's a LOT of rooms to clean!"</p>

                <p>775 ROOMS?! My ears perked up so high they almost touched! "That means 775 places to explore! And 775 places for treats to be hidden!" I woofed hopefully.</p>

                <p>"We walked to Buckingham Palace," said Lexi, her voice full of excitement and pride.</p>
                
                <p>"This is where the King lives!" she continued, pointing at the magnificent building with her paw.</p>
                
                <p>"The KING?!" I barked, jumping up and down with so much excitement I thought I might take off like a helicopter. "Can I meet him? Can I? Can I?"</p>

                <p>"Look, Flo! The guards are changing," said Lexi, always noticing the important details.</p>

                <p>And she was right! We could see the famous guards in their red uniforms and tall black hats marching in perfect formation. They looked so serious and official!</p>

                <p>"But I want to see the KING!" I said, jumping up and down like a bouncing ball. "I want to meet him SO BADLY!"</p>

                <p>Lexi smiled at me with that patient, understanding look she always gives me when I get too excited. "Maybe next time, Flo."</p>

                <p>Even though I couldn't meet the King (yet!), watching the Changing of the Guard was SPECTACULAR! The guards marched with such precision, their red uniforms were so bright and beautiful, and their big furry black hats were taller than me!</p>
                
                <p>"Lexi, why don't their hats fall off?" I whispered, tilting my head in confusion.</p>
                
                <p>Lexi giggled. "They're secured with chin straps, Flo! And they're very well-trained guards who've practiced for years!"</p>

                <p>The ceremony had music, marching, and such wonderful pageantry! There were so many people watching - families with children, tourists with cameras, and everyone was smiling and excited.

                <p>As the sun began to set and we rode the red bus through the streets of London, I pressed my nose against the window one last time to see Buckingham Palace in the distance. The light was catching the windows just right, making the whole palace seem to glow with magic.</p>
                
                <p>"Goodbye, palace!" I woofed quietly. "Goodbye, King! Maybe next time I'll meet you!"</p>
                
                <p>Lexi gave me a gentle pat on the head. "You know what, Flo? I have a feeling we'll be back. This is just the beginning of our royal adventures!"</p>
                
                <p>And you know what? I couldn't wait for whatever adventure came next! Whether it's meeting the King, exploring another famous landmark, or discovering a hidden gem in London, as long as I had Lexi by my side, every day would be an adventure!</p>
