## 📖 THE COMPLETE ADVENTURE OPENING

Here's how the story begins:

```
"LEXI! LEXI! IT'S RED! IT'S TALL! IT HAS TWO FLOORS!!!"

We Made It to London!

Okay, so I might have been SO excited on the journey to London that I 
barely slept. I couldn't help it! We were going to LONDON! The city 
with Big Ben and palaces and... and... I didn't even know what else 
yet, but I was SO ready to find out!

When we finally arrived, Lexi and I stepped out into the London streets 
for the very first time. The air smelled different. The sounds were 
different. Everything was AMAZING!

Lexi, being her usual smart self, had already studied the map before 
we left. "Okay, Flo," she said, adjusting her green backpack. "First, 
we need to figure out how to get around the city. We should find—"

But I wasn't listening. Because THAT'S when I saw it.

A RED BUS.

But not just ANY red bus. This bus was TALL. Like, really REALLY tall. 
Like TWO buses stacked on top of each other tall!

"LEXI! LEXI! LOOK!" I barked, spinning in three complete circles 
because my tail was wagging so hard I lost my balance.

Lexi stopped calmly, adjusted her green backpack with one paw, and 
looked up from the map she was studying. "Flo, it's just a bus."

"IT'S A TWO-STORY BUS, LEXI!" I practically howled with excitement.
```
